Just a little app to help build and preview a jamfHelper window.

Icon selection can be accomplished either by dragging the icon onto the dropdown button or clicking the button and browsing to the file.

Line returns can be added to the heading or description by using option+return within the text field.

Use the preview button to verify the command displays the desired look.
